[ pick up here]

## March 29, 2022

* After exploring the Cicek ship that crashed nearby, the party returned to Parvati. Along the way, a careful investigation of the ship revealed the 4th and final quirk of the Owl Bear, which was the **Secret Smuggling Compartment**.
* Malek and Ilse were careful to leave anything on the ship that would be illegal on Parvati. They went to Malek's previous contact the seller of odds-and-ends. We couldn't remember his name but called him Luigi (later I looked up in my notes that we previously called him Mr. Miotti, based on a flashback that Malek had). I determined he has Liaison-3, but an INT mod of +0. Malek got an Effect of 2 on a Liaison roll to sell the goods.
* Ilsa bought Hiram Van Duessen a 225 Cr bottle of whiskey for given the party the lead to the Secret Alien Base
* Malek and Ilsa found listings for two Cicek "churches" in Parvati City. They visited the first, and found that it's not exactly a church. The sign on the door translated to *Cicek Woman Club: Tribe Sister Parvati*. Inside, they met a female Cicek named Silvertail Stripe. She was friendly and is the assistant ambassador here, working under Honorable One Eye. She agreed to buy the Cicek vacc suit from the party, and also offered to read the captain's log and summarize. She said to come back in 2 days.
* This is where we wrapped up the session, a few minutes early.


## April 12, 2022

This game was a bit weird. First, I was rushed because I didn't have time to fully prepare something. I did a lot of prep work, but mostly just catching up on stuff, instead of actually planning what should happen in this session. Second, there were only two players - Dan and Chad. Em had to work, Kevin was in a bad mood, Matt had to do family stuff before leaving town, and I've given up on Scott being part of this group until his job situation changes.

### The Plan

Here's what I had planned for the evening, written on a sticky note:

* Recap [DONE]
* Update characters [DONE - only needed to do Chad's]
* Flashback discussion on ship while returning
* Topic: How have you customized your living quarters? [DONE]
* Cicek captain's log book and vacc suit [DONE]
* Flash way back to Encounter - your PC is an ancestor of your other PC
* Next... [I have no idea what I meant by this.

So in the end, I decided to fall back partly on an old idea and make a second attempt at playing **Encounter at Kallamattar**. I jotted these notes down for that. However, we didn't play it because there were only 2 players.


### What Actually Happened

* Converted Harshit to Cepheus Deluxe
* How have you been personalizing your living quarters on the Owl Bear?
	* Harshit
		* has been collecting skin, hair, and blood from fellow crewmembers, without their knowledge
		* getting a poster of a pop scientist for cabin
	* Malek
		* stylish and tasteful fake plants in cabin
		* weird art
* On returning to Parvati, Ilse is in the hospital recovering from combat with the security robot at the abandoned base
* Malek and Harshit visited the Cicek ambassador's assistant, Silvertail Stripe
	* Sold her the Cicek sized hostile environment vacc suit from the crashed Cicek ship on Brahmagupta
	* Received her translation of the ending of the **Cicek Captain's Log**
	* Bought a letter of introduction for "Malek of the Windsor Tribe of Earth"
		* Malek paid 5000 Cr for it
		* So I determined secretly that it will be worth +3 reaction to Ciceks who read it
		* It recounts his glorious history:
			* chased off Zhuzzh pirates twice
			* rabble rousing
			* protected glory fo Terran Kingdom from "Mud People" invasion
			* sworn vengeance against Mud People (the Reticulans)
	* They also learned that the Seven Spear Tribe (which is the tribe of the Balanced Spear IX that was wrecked on Brahmagupta) is one of the four tribes that is dominant in the Alula system
* Sold 11 kCr worth of electronic parts for 17 kCr to Luigi
* Sold 1 microfusion battery for 60 kCr


## May 24, 2022

### The Plan

* The date is January 5, 2261
* Start **Ep 203 - The Hostage Situation**


### What Actually Happened

* It's been over a month since our last game, unfortunately.
* Converted Orlan Gat (Em's character) to Cepheus Deluxe
* Recapped enough to bring everyone up to speed
* Attendees were Em, Matt, and Chad. Matt's wife is now in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. I'm pretty sure he's going to have to drop out of the game once the kid is born.
* I gave the player their choice of three items from the menu:
	* an adventure with a clear adventure hook (**The Hostage Situation**)
	* a flashback one shot in a Lasers and Feelings type game that is a different ruleset but is in the same universe, and connects their TSAO PCs with some characters two generations before (**Encounter at Kallamattar, Take 2**)
	* wander around sandbox-style and see what trouble they get into (total improvisation)
* The players chose the first, so we started **Ep 203 - The Hostage Situation**.
* I handed over the prop, which was the ransom note. Malek read it and immediately collapsed on the floor. Harshit rushed to his aid and gave medical attention, while Ilse read the note aloud.
* The PCs didn't do much investigation ahead of time. Instead, they came up with a plan and put it into motion.
* They filled up briefcase with 50,000 Cr, the ransom requested. But the briefcase also had two tracking devices in it - one hidden in the lining and one disguised as a 1000 credit chip.
* Ilse bought an expensive suit and got an expensive haircut. She looked two social levels above her normal class.
* Harshit and Orlan rented a hotel room on the 4th floor, down the hall from Room 410 where Dr. Reza Perry supposedly is staying.
* Then Ilse posed as a courier with the briefcase and tried to bluff her way into the hotel. It didn't go well, but after threatening the clerk (Bobby) and the manager (Karen) with a gun, Bobby took Ilse upstairs so she could deliver the briefcase in person.
* Unknown to the PCs (though they could guess), Karen the manager called Security after Ilse and Bobby went into the elevator.
* Ilse and Harshit did a complex maneuver where ultimately Bobby escaped to the stairs, Harshit got a bucket of ice, and Ilse surprised the security guards near the elevator. There were also two merchants who got off an elevator just then, but once they saw guns out, they jumped back in their elevator and left.
* A gunfight broke out. Ilse got shot, but her bulletproof vest saved her and she was only scratched. Harshit attacked one security guard with the ice bucket, and then with his energy pistol. Meanwhile, Ilse was attacking both guards with her revolver. The guards attacked back, one with fists and one with a revolver. By the end of the short fight, both guards were down with mortal wounds.
* Orlan exited the scene by taking the briefcase down the stairs, and leaving it at the front desk. Harshit rode the elevator down with the two guards, and then snuck away in the commotion. Ilse snuck out the back door. Everyone met back up at their apartment.
* I don't think the PCs know it, but both guards survived trauma surgery, one better than the other.
* Attempts to contact the tracking devices failed - they were either out of range or no longer operational. (The players don't know this yet, but I decided the kidnappers got the briefcase, took the money, spotted the tracking devices, and destroyed them)
* Where we left off, the party is getting ready to make a hasty exit from Parvati.
* Good things:
	* The two security guards aren't dead, so the PCs aren't murderers
	* The kidnappers got paid and released Hiram van Duessen, though he hasn't reappeared yet so the PCs don't know this
	* The hotel can be bribed to keep all this hush-hush
* Bad things:
	* There's probably (though maybe not) security footage showing that the PCs are the perpetrators
	* If word gets out that the PCs were the cause of this shooting spree, it could make things very touchy with their contact/patron the head of security
* I did not even touch on the subplot **Interstellar Tree Hugger**. I could use that next time, or just shelve it and reuse it later. With the party making what might be a rushed exit from Parvati, now might not be the time.
* It's now January 7, 2261.

### Recap I emailed to players

Here's a digested version of the above, but with some extra info.

*     Ransom note to Malek says the party's ally Hiram Van Duessen (the belter with the giant spaceship) has been kidnapped for 50,000 Cr ransom.
*     Malek nearly has a heart attack from reading this news, and is out of the adventure. Randy has been partying with the natives and decides to sleep it off.
*     Harshit, Ilse, and Orlan hatch a plot. They put the ransom money in a briefcase along with two hidden tracking devices. The party rents a room in the hotel where the ransom is to be delivered. The three enter separately, under mutually-supportive guises.
*     Ilse turns up the violence unexpectedly. Orlan and Harshit improvise. Long story short, the money is delivered by the deadline, two hotel guards are shot and nearly killed (probably on security camera), and the trio escapes the hotel.
*     The party regroups at their apartment on Parvati - the one paid for by the party's quasi-patron Gyzor Ling, Director of Security for Parvati Downport Region, Solana Trading.
*     The suitcase is delivered to someone - hopefully the kidnappers - but the tracking devices stop working. Van Duessen's status remains unknown.
*     Probable next step: hasty exit from the Parvati system, before the police start asking questions
    


## June 7, 2022

### The Plan

* Scene: Video call from Hiram Van Duessen.
	* Don't forget he talks like Quint from *Jaws*
	* Show the picture of him
	* He has been released, and woke up drugged next to his shuttle in its landing bay at the starport.
	* The **Misty's Way** is in orbit.
	* He is inclined to leave Parvati at once. 
	* He also has a strong hunch his kidnappers were members of **The Consortium**. He doesn't know much about the organization, except that it's an interstellar organized crime syndicate. He has no proof of this, just a feeling.
* Possible Scene: Gyzor Ling contacts the PCs - is there anything I should know
* Possible Scene: TNR News Report - reporting live; possible gang violence
* Possible Scene: gun and knife show - **Sky Harbor Knife and Gun Show - Parvati City Center, South Convention Hall - Children get in free. Adults 5 Cr.**

Then who knows what happens...

* Possible Scene: Risks and Rudra, Part 1 - Pirates in Parvati
* Scene: Risks and Rudra, Part 2 - To Rudra
* Scene: Risks and Rudra, Part 3 - Natural Disaster


### What Actually Happened

The first part was lots of things in parallel. The three active party members - Malek, Ilse, and Harshit - split up for much of this.

* Malek tried to hack into the Marriott hotel computer, I think so he could delete any video evidence from the assault the previous night. But he failed **and** his intrusion attempt was detected! This didn't have an immediate effect. Perhaps there will be repercussions in the future?
* Malek went to the bank and took out the cash from Luigi in a briefcase - hard currency
* Scarlet Minaru showed up at the office of Zephyros Professional Services to kick off the **Subplot: Interstellar Tree Hugger** part of Ep 203
* The party decided they should get ready to leave Parvati as soon as practical
* Hiram called Malek to let him know he's free, and thank him
* While meeting with Jasmine Peele and Scarlet Minaru, the party's attention was drawn to the tri-vid screen where there was a live newscast about the attack in the Marriott hotel ("TNR News Report - reporting live; possible gang violence" above)
* Gyzor Ling called Malek to see if he knows anything about what happened at the Marriott
* Ilse was staying out of sight, so Harshit and Malek went to Luigi's shop on a shopping spree, to spend all the credit they have there
* The party saw the sign for **Sky Harbor Knife and Gun Show** but it wasn't of interest
* Ilse did go visit Hiram as he was preparing to take off and leave Parvati for a while. She tried to get an idea of whether he was in on the kidnapping - did he kidnap himself? He seemed to be totally honest about the whole thing, and thankful. He was only about 50% there, mentally.

Then the trio assembled to follow the lead for the **Interstellar Tree Hugger** subplot.

* Went to level 4, used the newly-acquired sonar window to detect a passage on the other side of a wall, and found a secret door and the trigger for it.
* The three went through the door into the hidden area that Jasmine Peele had mentioned in their meeting. There was nobody there. This was Level 4.
* Next, the party is going to proceed to Level 5. I have no idea how that actually works, so we'll just skip ahead a bit and do it abstractly.
* Where we left off, each character made a Stealth check to proceed in secret. There was one success and two failures - Ilse: 1, Malek: 9, Harshit: 2. Next time, we'll find out what that means!
* I gave out 1 XP to each PC who was active in this session

Some other important points to remember for the future:

* Malek's intrusion attempt on the Marriott computer was detected.
* We determined that exchanging UTR credits in Cicek space will be easy. Maybe they will even just take the currency along the border, since they're friendly to the terrans.
* I need to learn (or rule) how the Double Tap trait of a firearm works in Cepheus Deluxe. See Discord discussion here: [https://discord.com/channels/684007973785174026/685058961996906496/985627729007378513](https://discord.com/channels/684007973785174026/685058961996906496/985627729007378513)


## June 21, 2022

### The Plan

* The scene skips forward. Ilse and Harshit have been detected and are being confronted by Spike's gang<sup>1</sup>. They were scouting ahead while Malek was attempting to detect any surveillance networks in the area, and they walked right into an ambush. "That's far enough. Hands where we can all see them, mates."
* The group is now on Level 5.
* Depending on how the group decides to proceed, it could turn into a gunfight with Spike's gang, or maybe they could parley or even make friends! Reaction rolls will lead the way.
* The PCs will (probably) eventually find the airlock leading to the mines, and a Zero-G/Int skill check of 8+ will reveal that the seal on the airlock is damaged, with air flowing out of Level 5 into the mines.
* If they encounter the creature, they'll find it has these stats:

#### The Mena Blob Creature

Filter, 400 kg, 3D stamina, 6D lifeblood, +2D damage modifier

But due to its current state, its stamina and lifeblood are both reduced. It's very sick. Stamina=5, Lifeblood=12. To thrive it needs more atmosphere than the trace amounts that leak through the door.

Science/Int of 8+ will show that it is weakened.

Science/Edu of 10+ will show that it's not a typical xenofauna. It normally lives by flying and absorbing gases through its skin. It converts nitrogen (which is not very present in the atmosphere of Mena) into energy using a technique called "adiabatic nitrosynthesis".


<sup>1</sup> It's total coincidence that they're the ones who kidnapped Hiram in the other part of the adventure. I'm just reusing their stats because the PCs haven't met them yet, so they're new to the story.


### What Actually Happened

In attendance:

* Z (the new guy) - Aramis, retired belter
* Chad - Harshit, correcting past wrongs
* Matt - Else, the muscle
* Dan - Malek, captain

* Malek’s hacker device is called **TAMrend 2,1 identity masker and encryption module** and gives DM+2 on Computer checks related to intrusion and security
* Session started with Aramis locked up in a storeroom, Harshit and Ilse being confronted by thugs, and Malek staying behind to do some hacking
* Ilse tried to get the thugs to surrender without a fight, but one of them was super stupid and opened fire. In the end, 2 of the thugs were down with major wounds, 1 thug was down with a mortal wound, and the 1 female thug (Lulu) was let go to carry the rest of them to get medical attention
* PCs proceeded to find the airlock from the inside, and Malek hacked in to open up the electronic locks. The group noticed that air was leaking out.
* They backed out of Level 5 safely and came in from the outside in vacc suits in the grav car
* The party found and explored the mine tunnels, and found the alien blob creature
* They lured it into the airlock using air from the vacc suits, and Harshit took a sample of it for analysis later
* Then the group returned to the city, and sent a message to their patron (Scarlet) that there is indeed a creature, and it’s captured in the airlock
* About the same time, there was a news report that a huge organized pirate group was in a battle with a convoy of merchant ships, and all able craft are being asked to assist. But Owl Bear doesn’t have weapons.
* With that, the party loaded up in the Owl Bear and blasted off to leave the Parvati system, via a safe route in the opposite direction of the battle.
* Harshit is staying behind on Parvati to volunteer to provide medical aid to injured merchants as they arrive. [Because Chad is moving on the day of our next game and won’t be joining us any time soon, if ever]

On board **Owl Bear** leaving Parvati system:

* Malek
* Ilse
* Aramis
* Orlan
* Professor Gorshan
