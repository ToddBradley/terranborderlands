# Encounter at Kallamattar

*Encounter at Kallamattar* is a special episode of my *These Stars Are Ours!* campaign. It uses a ruleset called *Encounter* written by John Ayliff for the One-Page RPG Jam 2021.

[See here](https://johnayliff.itch.io/encounter) for the rules.

This special episode takes place decades before the rest of my campaign.

I created these character sheets for *Encounter* for this:

* [Encounter character sheet - double.pdf](<../Encounter character sheet - double.pdf>) - use this if you want two character sheets per page
* [Encounter character sheet - single.pdf](<../Encounter character sheet - single.pdf>) - use this if you want one character sheet per page
