# New Player Kit

I originally put together a collection of documents for new players that I called the New Player Kit. But since then, the ruleset switched from Cepheus Engine to Cepheus Deluxe. And the setting book switched from *These Stars Are Ours!* to *Terra Arisen*. So the new player kit is obsolete now.

Nothing else to see here.
