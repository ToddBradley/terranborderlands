## A note about references

On this site, when I refer to rules or setting material from specific books, I'll mark the reference so we know where it came from. Here are the shortcuts I use for that:

CESRD = *Cepheus Engine System Reference Document*, Samardan Press

CD = *Cepheus Deluxe*, Original Printing - September-October, 2021, Stellagama Publishing

TSAO = *These Stars Are Ours!*, Revision 2, Stellagama Publishing

## Things to read

UPDATED: [Cepheus Deluxe Personal Combat Quick Reference](<Cepheus Deluxe Personal Combat Quick Reference.pdf>) Version 2

Or perhaps the [Cepheus Deluxe Character Sheet](<Cepheus Deluxe Character Sheet.pdf>)
