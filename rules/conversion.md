# Converting PCs from Cepheus Engine to Cepheus Deluxe

## Introduction

*Cepheus Deluxe* is a new rule set for space opera sci-fi RPG campaigns, published by Stellagama Publishing. It is similar to *Cepheus Engine* but changes a few things to simplify the game, improve playability, and add some extra depth in places.

One thing that is simplified is character creation. But for my campaign, all the players already had characters created under the *Cepheus Engine* rules. So I wrote these conversion rules to apply to the existing characters to make them more compatible with *Cepheus Deluxe*.

Note to other referees: All these are "house rules" for my *These Stars Are Ours!* campaign. None of this should be considered canon. Maybe these conversion rules will work for your campaign, maybe not. You decide.

Page numbers are from *Cepheus Deluxe Original Printing - September - October 2021*. In some cases, I quote text from that rule book; literal quotes are set apart using indentation.

For brevity, I often use the acronym CE to mean *Cepheus Engine* and CD to mean *Cepheus Deluxe*.

## Characteristics

*Cepheus Deluxe* uses the same traditional six characteristics (sometimes called "attributes" or "stats") as *Cepheus Engine* and *Traveller*. Nothing changes here.

Characteristic Modifiers stay the same, too.

## Skills

### General Rules

The skill list in CD is much shorter. Some skills have been combined.

CD doesn't have cascade skills. So you no longer get a default zero-level skill in the other branches of the cascade tree that you didn't specialize in.

"Subsumes" below means that the skill existed in CE, and includes that meaning of the skill **plus** it also includes the other listed skill(s).

"Replaces" below means the skill either didn't exist in CE or was a cascade skill and you no longer must choose a specialty.

If you had any of the skills in brackets (one of the subsumed or replaced skills), the skill level is now the maximum of the main skill and any that have been subsumed or replaced.

**Example 1**: If you had Gambling-1 but not Carousing, you now have Carousing-1.

**Example 2**: If you had Gambling-1 **and** Carousing-1, you still have Carousing-1.


### Skill List

Below is the list of all 31 skills. In square brackets are notes about converting each one. Some of these notes come from the CD book, and some are things that just felt right to me when I compared the CE skill list to the CD skill list.

* Admin
* Aircraft [replaces Airship, Rotor Aircraft, and Winged Aircraft]
* Animals [replaces Farming, Riding, and Veterinary Medicine]
* Athletics [this is the only skill you can't use untrained]
* Carousing [subsumes Gambling]
* Computer [subsumes Comms and Prospecting]
* Deception
* Demolitions
* Driving [replaces Mole, Tracked Vehicle, and Wheeled Vehicle]
* Engineering
* Grav Vehicles
* Gun Combat [replaces Archery, Energy Pistol, Energy Rifle, Shotgun, Slug Pistol, and Slug Rifle]
* Gunnery [replaces Bay Weapons, Heavy Weapons, Screens, Spinal Mounts, and Turret Weapons]
* Heavy Weapons
* Investigation
* Jack Of All Trades
* Leadership
* Liaison [subsumes Bribery and Broker]
* Medicine
* Melee Combat [replaces Natural Weapons, Bludgeoning Weapons, Piercing Weapons, and Slashing Weapons]
* Piloting [subsumes Navigation]
* Recon
* Repair [replaces Electronics, Gravitics, and Mechanics]
* Science [replaces Physical Sciences, Social Sciences, and Space Sciences]
* Stealth
* Steward
* Streetwise
* Survival
* Tactics
* Watercraft [replaces Motorboats, Ocean Ships, Sailing Ships, and Submarine
* Zero-G [subsumes Battle Dress]

### The Unusual Case of Survival Skill

In *Cepheus Engine*, the Survival skill was a cascade skill off Animals. But in *Cepheus Deluxe*, it's now a separate skill and **not** subsumed by the CD Animals skill. To me, that makes much more sense.

### How Not To Be Seen - Recon and Stealth

In *Cepheus Engine*, the Recon skill was used both to spot hidden things and to hide from people trying to spot you. *Cepheus Deluxe* has two separate skills for that. Recon is now for spotting hidden things, but Stealth is used to hide from others. If you had Recon in CE, choose one or the other skill in CD, but not both, unless you have a level of 2 or more in which case you can split the levels between the two.

### Languages

CD characters know a number of languages equal to 1 + EDU modifier (minimum 1). There is no longer a Linguistics skill. If you had Linguistics in CE, you now simply know that many more languages.

### Homeworld Skills

Throw out any Homeworld Skills from *Cepheus Engine* that are still at level 0. Refer to the *Cepheus Deluxe* Homeworld Skills on p. 19. You get one skill relevant to your homeworld, at level 1. For the purposes of converting existing characters, this only applies to skills you don't already have at level 1 or greater.


## Contacts

*Cepheus Deluxe* doesn't have Allies and Enemies in the same way that *Cepheus Engine* does. Instead, there are Contacts (p. 36). Normally, you start the game with a number of Contacts equal to your SOC DM, and can gain more through the course of your career.

For the purposes of converting existing CE characters to CD, just take any Allies you already have, and start calling them Contacts instead. If your number of Allies is less than your SOC DM, make up enough new Contacts to fill in the gaps.

## Stamina and Lifeblood

*Cepheus Deluxe* bucks the old *Traveller* tradition of using the 3 physical characteristics for "hit points". Instead, it has 2 other characteristics. From p. 39:

> The character’s Stamina represents their toughness, and their ability to take a hit and shrug it off. Stamina is equal to the sum of character’s END Characteristic + Athletics skill. For example, a character with END 7 and Athletics 1 will have Stamina 8.

> The character’s Lifeblood represents their resistance to injury. It is equal to twice their Stamina.

> If the character lacks the Athletics skill, their Stamina simply equals their END score, and their Lifeblood simply equals twice their END score.

Speaking of Athletics, here's some funny trivia. Athletics is the one skill in *Cepheus Deluxe* that you can't use untrained. (not counting Jack Of All Trades, of course)

## Traits

Traits are a new concept in *Cepheus Deluxe*, and there's a whole chapter devoted to them, starting on p. 41.

Read the wonderful list, and choose one Trait for every two career terms you completed, with a minimum of one.

## Equipment

Keep your existing equipment. CD has some new equipment, and changes some details of old equipment. But for simplicity and continuity, nothing in my campaign will immediately change regarding old equipment.


# Other Notes for My Players

Here is a list of other things to point out to my gaming group in converting from *Cepheus Engine* to *Cepheus Deluxe*.

### Collaboration

The CD *Collaboration* rule (p. 11) replaces the CE *Aiding Another* rule.

> In some cases, characters may work together on a task throw. The character with the highest combined skill and characteristic DMs make the main skill throw. Any assistant can make a skill throw at the same difficulty as well; if they succeed, add DM+1 to the primary character’s throw; if they fail, the primary character suffers no penalty. There can only be one assistant to the main skill throw. However, the Referee is encouraged to allow other characters to assist the assistant. Each throw has the same difficulty as the original skill throw. Note that characters who are assisting in the throw do not necessarily have to use the same skill. If the player and Referee agree, a related skill task throw can assist. For example, a ship’s engineer might throw Engineering to assist the Pilot’s skill throw. Teamwork!

### Hero Points

We'll use the optional Individual Hero Points rule in the Terran Borderlands campaign. See p. 12 for the Hero Points rules.

You'll get two individual Hero Points at the start of each session; use 'em or lose 'em. But we won't use group Hero Points.

### Experience Points

Unlike *Cepheus Engine*, *Cepheus Deluxe* has an experience point (XP) system. In *Cepheus Deluxe*, you learn new skills (and languages and Traits) by spending XP for them.

To convert a CE PC into CD, take the number of weeks you have been studying a new skill and just use that as the number of unspent XP you have.

So, if you've been on a training program and have accumulated 4 weeks toward Piloting and 8 weeks toward Gun Combat, you now have 12 unspent XP. You can spend those immediately on skill advancement, or hold on to them and use them later.

By the way, don't make the mistake of thinking that just because the game uses XP now, there are levels or ranks. There aren't. XP is simply earned for adventuring, and then spent to improve your character, one thing at a time.
