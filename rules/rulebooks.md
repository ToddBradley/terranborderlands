# Official Rulebooks

## Cepheus Engine Rules

The *Terran Borderlands* campaign has switched from Cepheus Engine to Cepheus Deluxe. So this isn't relevant anymore.


## Cepheus Deluxe Rules

This is an evolution of *Cepheus Engine* that improves the game in too many ways to list here. *Cepheus Deluxe* by Stellagama Publishing is available in PDF, softcover, and hardcover formats from DriveThruRPG.

## These Stars Are Ours! Rules

This book has the game setting, including new careers and some custom rules. I bought the hardback version of the book and it's good quality.

Here is where to get a softcopy or hardcopy of the basic rulebook, plus some extra stuff like a character sheet and some deck plans:

## The Confusing Part

Now we are using the *These Stars Are Ours!* setting with the Cepheus Deluxe rules. And they don't perfectly go together, because TSAO was written to be based on *Cepheus Engine*. So we're improvising. Eventually Stellagama will publish an updated version of the TSAO setting rebased on *Cepheus Deluxe*. Parts of it are in playtest now.
