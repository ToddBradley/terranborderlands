of its legality in Terran or Reticulan space.
These creatures drew Cicek hunters to this world in
the late 22nd century, following the initial survey. The
fertile soil and pleasant climate soon drew Cicek
farmers as well. During the War, Fei Lian served as the
regional capital of Cicek space and the major transit
hub on the famed Cicek Run. This brought an influx of
commerce which now continues in peacetime trade
with the Terrans. The ruling elected council of tribal
matriarchs does not intervene in economic matters

> Adventuring Information: Humans are not likely to
work as colonists here, but trade and commerce with
the Cicek is always lucrative. Just bring enough
firepower when negotiations get touchy. Almost any
good may be found here, regardless of its rarity or
legality. This is a good place to search for expensive,
and illegal, specialty gear and weapons, a fact which
attracts many wealthy Terran pirates and smugglers
to Fei Lian.

## Background

From *Terra Arisen*:

> 


### Xi Ursae Majoris ACb

Rocky planet with no atmosphere or life, bathed in solar radiation


### Xi Ursae Majoris ACc

Rocky planet with carbon dioxide rich atmosphere


### Inner Asteroid Belt

Occupied by Long Tail Tribe, who have a cultural disgust and avoidance of Nine Fingers Tribe. It is rumored that there are pirates hiding out among the rocks. There are occasional unsubstantiated reports of precursor ruins that dot the rocks.

The inner asteroid belt lies between the 2nd and 3rd planets of the system.


### Xi Ursae Majoris ACd - Alula - Main Planet

Xi Ursae Majoris ACd, commonly called simply **Alula**, is a rocky planet with widely separated deep methane lakes. It is the primary world of the system, and home to the starport. It is the 3rd planet in the Alula system.

The atmosphere is "exotic", made of methane, helium, hydrogen, and some other gases. Travel outdoors requires a "breather with air supply" and heavy clothing (ideally, warmed by battery power). These breathers come in two types. 

The full size "standard breather" combines a face mask (similar to a scuba mask) and a pair of tanks that provide 6 hours of air. The breather assembly costs a mere Cr75, and the tanks can be refilled at any of thousands of shops for Cr20. It weighs 5 kg.

_Standard Breather (Terran model)_

More convenient is the "mini-breather" that has a more fashionable face mask and a single smaller tank that provides 1 hour of air. Mini-breathers come in a variety of colors and designs. They cost Cr100, but can be refilled at automated stations for Cr1. Mini-breathers only weigh 1 kg.

There are representatives of all Alula’s tribes on the planet Alula, except for the Long Tail Tribe.

#### The Starport

Alula's interstellar port is rated Type B, and there is both a "high port" and a "low port" here. The port is able to handle both streamlined and non-streamlined ships. By tradition and neutrality treaty, the **Nine Fingers Tribe** operates the starport.

Fuel refining operations on Alula are simple and easy, because several deep seas of mostly methane exist on the planet's surface. The larger ones have extraction and refining facilities, and the refined fuel is then sold at the low port. The major Cicek tribes in the system also have their own private fuel depots at these refineries.

#### Alula High Port

![Alula High Port](AlulaHighPort.png)


Alula High Port was originally built under Reticulan control, but later upgraded with help from the Cicek's Terran allies toward the end of the war.


#### Alula Low Port

![Alula Low Port](AlulaLowPort.png)

Alula Low Port is the center of trade in the system, and the startown that has cropped up around the port is known in Terran as **Prosperity City**.

### Xi Ursae Majoris ACe

This is a rocky planet wracked by volcanoes.


### Outer Asteroid Belt

Extremely wide band of asteroid that takes up multiple orbits. Astronomers believe this belt is much younger than the rest of the system, and represents three or even four planets that collided in the not-too-distant past.

There is some prospecting activity in the outer belt, which is much safer for travel than the inner belt.

## Major Cicek Tribes Present

With 780,000 Cicek present in the Alula system, there are literally hundreds of tribes. Many tribes are affiliated or offshoots of other tribes, and the relationships are too complex for most humans to understand or take an interest in. But there are five "major" tribes here. 

A **major tribe** is one that has its own starships, minor starports (repair stations), supply lines, and ability to project might into other systems. There are also **minor tribes** that have great power on a given planet (infantry, for example) but don't have the ability to protect that planet from spacefaring attackers.

The power levels shown below are subjective ratings from the (admittedly human-centric) **Explorer Society**. Beware that power levels change all the time. Consult local conditions.

### Nine Fingers Tribe

* operates the starport at *Alula Borealis g*
* power level: 2/6

### Seven Spear Tribe

* owners of the *Balanced Spear IX*, the starship wrecked on Brahmagupta (Parvati system) decades ago
* power level: 6/6
* they do not have a presence on Parvati currently

### Rain Tribe

* this is the tribe of Silvertail Stripe, assistant to the Cicek ambassador on Parvati
* power level: 3/6

### Tree Clinging Tribe

* power level: 3/6

### Long Tail Tribe

* inhabit the inner asteroid belt, known to act mostly as pirates preying on merchant activity (both Cicek and Terran)
* power level: 3/6
