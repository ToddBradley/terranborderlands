# The Rudra System

The Rudra system is a near neighbor to the Parvati system.

Name origin: *Rudra (/ˈrʊdrə/; Sanskrit: रुद्र) is a Rigvedic deity associated with wind or storm, Vayu and the hunt.*


There are only four places of interest in the Rudra system:

* "Rudra" - Wolf 359 c: a hostile planet with small boiling caustic oceans
* "Transom Rock": asteroid with sub-surface city, in orbit around Wolf 359 c
* "Valcent" - Wolf 369 f: a gas giant with an orbiting mass of interconnected ships and cargo containers, inhabited by a human group of separatists that consider themselves independent from the UTR
* "Gamma" - Wolf 396 g: an airless rocky planet that holds a UTR prison

There are two other gas giants and two other smaller planets in the system, but they aren't notable.

Wolf 359 is the star. Rudra is the 2nd planet from the star Wolf 359. Transom Rock orbits Rudra.

Transom Rock has 70k Humans and 30k Cicek. The humans are torn by violent political disagreement. Each views the other as a damnable heresy in need of extirpating. Local government may be able to keep open war from breaking out, but the poisonous hatred divides communities. The nature of the political disagreement is the Cicek. Half of the Terrans treat the Cicek population as friendly neighbors, and the other half want them to return to Cicek space now that the war is over.

### Background

From TSAO:


> Rudra used to be the last stop on the “Cicek Run” before entering Cicek space proper. Today, it is a major trading port with the Cicek Confederation. Rudra itself is a hellish world gripped by a runaway greenhouse effect which possesses a caustic atmosphere. The settlement is actually a large orbital station built into a metallic asteroid to protect its residents from Wolf 359’s infrequent but occasionally powerful stellar flares. Of Rudra’s hundred thousand residents, thirty thousand are Cicek traders and colonists. Their presence on this world over the last generation influenced local Terran culture and led to the infamous Rudra informality. The official government is content to stand back and let the locals run their own business undisturbed, much to the chagrin of the Ministry of Finance and the Economy, which would prefer a tighter grip on the flow of goods from and to Cicek space.

## Valcent - Wolf 359 f

![](valcent-rings.jpg)

Valcent (Wolf 359 f) is a gas giant with an extensive ring belt. In orbit is Valcent Harbor and a gas giant mine.

Valcent Harbor is a recent interstellar colony from elsewhere. They have cultural admiration for the Ciceks, and appreciate their freedom. It is occupied by empoverished separatist group. They need vital supplies.

Valcent Harbor is an orbiting mass of ships and cargo containers, lashed together to form a cluster or swarm of mutually supporting pods of people. The inhabitants are a human group of separatists that consider themselves independent from the UTR.


## Gamma - Wolf 359 g

Contains a United Terran Republic penal colony. Travel here is forbidden, under threat of death.
