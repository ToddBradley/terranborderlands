# Parvati Power Structure and Factions

The moon called Parvati has a population of 43,500. Half of those people live in a series of underground complexes that fan out from the starport. These complexes are built around and in mines, some active, some closed. This is commonly called Parvati City. The other half of the popuation live in several much smaller settlements scattered around hte moon.

Like all worlds in the UTR that arenâ€™t in the Sol system, Parvati is considered a colony. The UTR Ministry of Colonization and Space Travel (the same group that runs "The Scouts") has appointed a governor, Admiral (ret.) Tara Picon. Her domain is the entire star system, and on Parvati she shares power with the locally elected Parvati Planetary Council.


The starport was classed as Type B at the beginning of the war, but has since fallen to Type D.

## Factions

### Solana Trading Inc.

Solana currently holds the contract for the operation of the starport (Parvati Station) and Parvati City.

The Parvati Planetary Council has awarded a 10-year contract for the operation of the starport and Parvati City to a private interstellar megacorporation, Solana Trading Inc.

Mr. Gyzor Ling is officially Director of Security for Parvati Downport Region, and is an employee of Solana Trading Inc. His jurisdiction is formally limited to the starport and Parvati City, but he wields enough power and has enough prestige that nobody questions when he gets involved in affairs off-world or at other Parvati settlements. He is given great latitude in keeping the peace. He has held this position for more than a year, since the UTR military handed over control of the Parvati system to the civilian government.


### Parvati Planetary Council

The planetary council consists of the following:

* 13 representatives democratically elected by residents of Parvati
* At least one UTR governmental representative from each of the nine governmental ministries:
	* The Ministry of War
	* Ministry of Finance and the Economy
	* Ministry of Justice
	* Ministry of Education
	* Ministry of Colonization and Space Travel	* Ministry of Alien Affairs
	* Ministry of Health and Welfare
	* Ministry of Internal Affairs
