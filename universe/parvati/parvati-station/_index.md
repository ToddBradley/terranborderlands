The moon called Parvati (formally Gliese 408 c-4) is home to Parvati Station. It was once a Type B starport, but has since declined to Type D, a shadow of its former glory. There are entire sections that are unused these days. Some of those have been shut off and abandoned, and some hold gangs and squatters.

Years ago, there was both an operational "up port" and "down port". Parvati Up Port was the orbiting part of the starport, where the vast majority of repair and other shipyard services were. Parvati Down Port was mainly used by small craft. 

But the orbital component was destroyed during the war, leaving only the down port, which was renamed from Parvati Down Port to Parvati Station.


[Fill in something about the factions of Parvati - the governor, law enforcement, known contacts, etc.]
