Scout base, navy base, no gas giants!

What does this mean, given that the TSAO book says...

> the Cicek did not establish a proper naval base there but rather a smaller “scout” base.

Alula Borealis is the star



## Background

From TSAO:


> Alula is a recent Cicek colony, first settled in 2238 as a fortified waystation for the “Cicek Run”. By the mid-2240’s it grew into a small border fortress and naval refueling station, though the Cicek did not establish a proper naval base there but rather a smaller “scout” base. Initially deemed unappealing for settlements, the discovery of highly valuable complex compounds in Alula’s cryonic carbohydrate oceans drew enterprising Cicek tribes to harvest the chemicals and export them both to Cicek and Terran space. The world also remains an important spot on the Terra-Cicek trade route, though secondary in its importance to the more habitable Fei Lian. Typical for the Cicek, no real law exists beyond the tribal level and there are no restrictions on goods or armament. The Nine Fingers tribe operates the starport and stays neutral in the otherwise cutthroat – sometimes literally so competition between the four other local Cicek tribes.

Gas giants: 0


### Hidden, Unknown Civilization on Alula Borealis c

Shackled World: This world is being systematically contained by an outside power. Some ancient autonomous defense grid, robot law enforcement, alien artifact, or other force is preventing the locals from developing certain technology, or using certain devices, or perhaps from developing interstellar flight. This limit may or may not apply to offworlders; in the former case, the PCs may have to figure out a way to beat the shackles simply to escape the world.

Enemy: Enigmatic alien master

Friend: Scientist with a plan to break the chains

Conflict: An outside power greatly profits from the shackles

Things: Tech shielded from the shackle

Places: Grim high-tech control center


### Main World (Alula Borealis g)

Primary world of the system, and home to the starport. It is the 6th planet in the Alula Borealis system.

There are representatives of all Alula's tribes here, except for the Long Tail Tribe.


### Asteroid Belt

Occupied by Long Tail Tribe, who have a cultural disgust and avoidance of Nine Fingers Tribe. Contact point - trade in vital goods. They are pirates hiding out among the rocks. Ancient ruins dot the rocks.

The belt lies between Alula Borealis d (the 3rd planet) and Alula Borealis e (the 4th planet).
