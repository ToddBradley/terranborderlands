## About this Site

This site was created by me, Todd Bradley, for my _These Stars Are Ours!_ campaign in Denver, Colorado. You can [contact me here](mailto:todd@toddbradley.com).

I put this site together using Jekyll, an open-source static site generator. A previous generation of this site used Hugo, but it was a pain in the ass. So I switched to Jekyll.

## About the Game

_These Stars Are Ours!_ is a campaign setting for Cepheus Engine, which is a science fiction table top role playing game. Cepheus Engine is a free variant of the 1st edition Mongoose Traveller game, which in turn evolved from the original Classic Traveller game from 1977.

## My Own Sources of Inspiration

Here are my main sources of inspiration for the campaign style and setting. Lower down on this page are the inspirations noted by the authors of the campaign setting.

* My "These Stars Are Ours!" Apple Music playlist - [listen here](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/these-stars-are-ours/pl.u-2aoqPBeiGE7p1)
* _Solaris_ - [the Steven Soderberg film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(2002_film))
* _The Expanse_ - [the television series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)) - I intend to read the books someday, but haven't had time to start
* _2001: A Space Odyssey_ - [the film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)) that changed science fiction forever
