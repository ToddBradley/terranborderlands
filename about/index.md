## About this Site

This site was created by me, Todd Bradley, for my _Terra Arisen_ campaign in Denver, Colorado. You can [contact me here](mailto:todd@toddbradley.com).

I put this site together using Jekyll, an open-source static site generator. A previous generation of this site used Hugo, but it was a pain in the ass. So I switched to Jekyll.

## About the Game

_Terra Arisen_ is a campaign setting for *Cepheus Deluxe*, which is a science fiction table top role playing game. *Cepheus Deluxe* is one of several descendents of the original classic *Traveller* game from 1977.

## My Sources of Inspiration

Here are my main sources of inspiration for the campaign style and setting. 

* My "These Stars Are Ours!" Apple Music playlist - [listen here](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/these-stars-are-ours/pl.u-2aoqPBeiGE7p1)
* _Solaris_ - [the Steven Soderberg film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(2002_film))
* _The Expanse_ - [the television series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)) - I intend to read the books someday, but haven't had time to start
* _2001: A Space Odyssey_ - [the film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)) that changed science fiction forever
