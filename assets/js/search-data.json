It is similar to Cepheus Engine but changes a few things to simplify the game, improve playability, and add some extra depth in places. One thing that is simplified is character creation. But for my campaign, all the players already had characters created under the Cepheus Engine rules. So I wrote these conversion rules to apply to the existing characters to make them more compatible with Cepheus Deluxe. Note to other referees: All these are “house rules” for my These Stars Are Ours! campaign. None of this should be considered canon. Maybe these conversion rules will work for your campaign, maybe not. You decide. Page numbers are from Cepheus Deluxe Original Printing - September - October 2021. In some cases, I quote text from that rule book; literal quotes are set apart using indentation. For brevity, I often use the acronym CE to mean Cepheus Engine and CD to mean Cepheus Deluxe. – Todd Bradley, todd@toddbradley.com, updated 01-August-2022 . ",

    "title": "Skills",
    "content": "General Rules . The skill list in CD is much shorter. Some skills have been combined. CD doesn’t have cascade skills. So you no longer get a default zero-level skill in the other branches of the cascade tree that you didn’t specialize in. “Subsumes” below means that the skill existed in CE, and includes that meaning of the skill plus it also includes the other listed skill(s). “Replaces” below means the skill either didn’t exist in CE or was a cascade skill and you no longer must choose a specialty. If you had any of the skills in brackets (one of the subsumed or replaced skills), the skill level is now the maximum of the main skill and any that have been subsumed or replaced. Example 1: If you had Gambling-1 but not Carousing, you now have Carousing-1. Example 2: If you had Gambling-1 and Carousing-1, you still have Carousing-1. Skill List . Below is the list of all 31 skills. In square brackets are notes about converting each one. Some of these notes come from the CD book, and some are things that just felt right to me when I compared the CE skill list to the CD skill list. | Admin | Aircraft [replaces Airship, Rotor Aircraft, and Winged Aircraft] | Animals [replaces Farming, Riding, and Veterinary Medicine] | Athletics | Carousing [subsumes Gambling] | Computer [subsumes Comms and Prospecting] | Deception | Demolitions | Driving [replaces Mole, Tracked Vehicle, and Wheeled Vehicle] | Engineering | Grav Vehicles | Gun Combat [replaces Archery, Energy Pistol, Energy Rifle, Shotgun, Slug Pistol, and Slug Rifle] | Gunnery [replaces Bay Weapons, Heavy Weapons, Screens, Spinal Mounts, and Turret Weapons] | Heavy Weapons | Investigation | Jack Of All Trades | Leadership | Liaison [subsumes Bribery and Broker] | Medicine | Melee Combat [replaces Natural Weapons, Bludgeoning Weapons, Piercing Weapons, and Slashing Weapons] | Piloting [subsumes Navigation] | Recon | Repair [replaces Electronics, Gravitics, and Mechanics] | Science [replaces Physical Sciences, Social Sciences, and Space Sciences] | Stealth | Steward | Streetwise | Survival | Tactics | Watercraft [replaces Motorboats, Ocean Ships, Sailing Ships, and Submarine | Zero-G [subsumes Battle Dress] | . The Unusual Case of Survival Skill . In Cepheus Engine, the Survival skill was a cascade skill off Animals. But in Cepheus Deluxe, it’s now a separate skill and not subsumed by the CD Animals skill. To me, that makes much more sense. How Not To Be Seen - Recon and Stealth . In Cepheus Engine, the Recon skill was used both to spot hidden things and to hide from people trying to spot you. Cepheus Deluxe has two separate skills for that. Recon is now for spotting hidden things, but Stealth is used to hide from others. If you had Recon in CE, choose one or the other skill in CD, but not both, unless you have a level of 2 or more in which case you can split the levels between the two. Languages . CD characters know a number of languages equal to 1 + EDU modifier (minimum 1). There is no longer a Linguistics skill. If you had Linguistics in CE, you now simply know that many more languages. Homeworld Skills . Throw out any Homeworld Skills from Cepheus Engine that are still at level 0. Refer to the Cepheus Deluxe Homeworld Skills on p. 19. You get one skill relevant to your homeworld, at level 1. For the purposes of converting existing characters, this only applies to skills you don’t already have at level 1 or greater. ",

To convert a CE PC into CD, take the number of weeks you have been studying a new skill and just use that as the number of unspent XP you have. So, if you’ve been on a training program and have accumulated 4 weeks toward Piloting and 8 weeks toward Gun Combat, you now have 12 unspent XP. You can spend those immediately on skill advancement, or hold on to them and use them later. By the way, don’t make the mistake of thinking that just because the game uses XP now, there are levels or ranks. There aren’t. XP is simply earned for adventuring, and then spent to improve your character, one thing at a time. ",

    "content": "Flashback Rule . Once per session, each player may declare a flashback. During the flashback, the player takes over narrative control of the game to describe something that happened in the past that has some relevance to the current story. The goal is to eliminate the need to over-prepare for an adventure, in order to get into the main story quicker. These flashbacks could relate to equipment a character has at his disposal, contacts the character has made in the past, or special knowledge the character has because of his background. Of course, there are limits to this. The flashback isn’t meant to replace or short circuit a story, or derail another character’s chance to shine. Some good examples: . Previous PC contact: . Harbormaster Jameson? Oh, I know him from way back. We’re not close friends, but when I was in the Marines our ship had to make an emergency landing, and my commanding officer sent me to negotiate with Jameson when he was just a junior administrator. I’m sure he remembers me, because I bribed him with a Reticulan stimbot we had captured from an enemy ship. Doing something implicitly in character: . I didn’t mention it then, but before we left the planet’s surface, I took a sample of the foliage - a small flowering bush that the primitive natives use to heal burns. Perhaps the doctor can extract the healing properties and use that on the wound. Special equipment: . Shortly after mustering out, I spent some of my cash to buy a black market psionic shield helmet. It’s been at the bottom of my backpack this whole time, so I’m taking it out now to put it on. Some bad examples: . Short circuit the adventure: . I’m using my flashback to say that the enemy starship captain developed a weak heart due to a medical accident. When he woke up today, he felt weak and had a deep sense of doom, knowing today is the day his heart will fail. Short circuit the adventure: . Oh, I forgot to mention I have the security code to activate the self-destruct sequence for the power plant supplying this entire city. Unbalanced power: . Nobody knows, but I’m really the universe’s greatest computer expert, and have an army of sentient robots at my command. I give them the order to de-cloak their ship and send a lifeboat to rescue us all. PC Bonds . Play out a scene with a crewmate to increase your bond with them. This can be a conversation or a narrative montage. This bond improves your ability to use the Aiding Another rule with each other in the future. Here is the Collaboration rule, from Cepheus Deluxe: . In some cases, characters may work together on a task throw. The character with the highest combined skill and characteristic DMs make the main skill throw. Any assistant can make a skill throw at the same difficulty as well; if they succeed, add DM+1 to the primary character’s throw; if they fail, the primary character suffers no penalty. There can only be one assistant to the main skill throw. However, the Referee is encouraged to allow other characters to assist the assistant. Each throw has the same difficulty as the original skill throw. Note that characters who are assisting in the throw do not necessarily have to use the same skill. If the player and Referee agree, a related skill task throw can assist. For example, a ship’s engineer might throw Engineering to assist the Pilot’s skill throw. Teamwork! . For every point of PC Bond your character has with another, you get a +1 on the skill check to be an assistant. Here is an example: . Abel and Baker have a PC Bond of +4. Abel has Computer-2 skill and Baker has Repair-1 skill. Baker decides to help Abel on a particularly important task, and the Referee rules that Repair can be used to help in this situation. The task has the following task description: . Construct a mnemonic memory device using stone knives and bear skins: Computer, Intelligence, 1d6 hours, Difficult . A Difficult skill check requires 10+ to succeed. Abel and Baker both have an Intelligence modifier of +0. First, Baker (the “assistant”) rolls 7 on 2D6. Adding his skill of +1 and the PC Bond of +4, that adds up to 12. That beats the 10+ target, giving DM+1 on Abel’s roll. Then, Abel rolls 6 on 2D6. He adds his skill of +2, and the Collaboration bonus he got from Baker of +2. That adds up to 10, barely enough to succeed in the check. If Abel and Baker didn’t have that PC Bond, though, Baker would have only gotten an 8, falling short of the 10 required. That, in turn, would mean Abel wouldn’t get the DM+1, and his total would be only 9, a failure. Good thing they work together so well! . Personal Combat Tweaks . Double Tap: You can fire a second time in the same action, with +1 die of damage and DM-2 to hit. Yes, a Double Tap weapon can fire 4 shots per round, if the PC does nothing but 2 Attack actions that round. Aiming gives +2 bonus per action instead of +1 bonus (maximum of +6) . ",

A Static Pulser requires one Hardpoint to install, fills 2 tons, and costs MCr6. Using a Static Pulser requires an Engineering/INT 8+ roll to hit. On any successful hit, roll 1D6; on 1-2 the target’s sensors suffer one level of damage (as per the combat rules), while on 3-6 the target’s electronics suffers one level of damage, as described in the Space Combat chapter. An Effects of 2+ on this Engineering roll causes two hits, and critical success (Effect 6+) means that the target ship is completely and immediately paralyzed. Note that the Static Pulser is powerful enough that a successful hit will simply fry the electronic systems of a regular vehicle. | A Static Pulser can be installed in any standard hardpoint at a Type A or B starport. | It does not require a turret; it uses the whole hardpoint. | It requires a gunner to operate. In this case the assigned gunner uses Engineering skill instead of Gunnery skill. | In space combat, the gunner assigned to the Static Pulser uses the Fire Energy Weapons action to attack an enemy ship (Engineering/INT 8+), as described on Cepheus Deluxe p. 147. | Alternatively, on his action the gunner can use the Static Pulser to defend against incoming missiles, but only one missile at a time. Declare the Point Defense action, and target one missile. A throw of Engineering/INT 8+ permanently disables that missile’s onboard targeting and detonation system. | The gunner assigned to the Static Pulser can receive assistance from another crewmember using the Collaboration rule. The assisting crewmember must be free to assist and not occupying another position on the ship. Typical skills to assist are Engineering, Computer, and Gunnery but be creative. | . ",

    "content": "From Terra Arisen: . Alula is a recent Cicek colony, first settled in 2238 as a fortified waystation on the “Cicek Run”. By the mid-2240’s it grew into a small border fortress and naval refueling station, though the Cicek never did establish a proper naval base there, just a smaller “scout” base. Initially deemed unappealing for settlements, the discovery of highly valuable complex compounds in Alula’s hydrocarbon-rich oceans drew enterprising Cicek tribes to harvest the chemicals and export them both to Cicek and Terran space. The world also remains an important spot on the Terra-Cicek trade route, though secondary in its importance to the more habitable Fei Lian. Typical for the Cicek, no real law exists beyond the tribal level and there are no restrictions on goods or armament. The Nine Fingers tribe operates the starport and stays neutral in the otherwise cutthroat – sometimes literally so – competition between the other four Cicek tribes on the world. Migration . Alula went from “essentially unsettled” to a population of 780,000 (not counting non-Cicek) in only 22 years, between 2238 and 2360. The immigration rate averages around 3000 new arrivals every month, keeping a minor fleet of passenger liners busy, mostly Fairsky class (800 ton) transports. Xi Ursae Majoris ACb . Rocky planet with no atmosphere or life, bathed in solar radiation . Xi Ursae Majoris ACc . Rocky planet with carbon dioxide rich atmosphere . Inner Asteroid Belt . Occupied by Long Tail Tribe, who have a cultural disgust and avoidance of Nine Fingers Tribe. It is rumored that there are pirates hiding out among the rocks. There are occasional unsubstantiated reports of precursor ruins that dot the rocks. The inner asteroid belt lies between the 2nd and 3rd planets of the system. Xi Ursae Majoris ACd - Alula - Main Planet . Alula from space . Alula satellite map . (planet randomly generated from https://topps.diku.dk/torbenm/maps.msp) . Xi Ursae Majoris ACd, commonly called simply Alula, is a rocky planet with widely separated deep methane lakes. It is the primary world of the system, and home to the starport. It is the 3rd planet in the Alula system. The atmosphere is “exotic”, made of methane, helium, hydrogen, and some other gases. Travel outdoors requires a “breather with air supply” and heavy clothing (ideally, warmed by battery power). These breathers come in two types. The full size “standard breather” combines a face mask (similar to a scuba mask) and a pair of tanks that provide 6 hours of air. The breather assembly costs a mere Cr75, and the tanks can be refilled at any of thousands of shops for Cr20. It weighs 5 kg. Standard Breather (Terran model) . More convenient is the “mini-breather” that has a more fashionable face mask and a single smaller tank that provides 1 hour of air. Mini-breathers come in a variety of colors and designs. They cost Cr100, but can be refilled at automated stations for Cr1. Mini-breathers only weigh 1 kg. One of this year’s most-fashionable mini-breathers, among the Terran minority . There are representatives of all Alula’s tribes on the planet Alula, except for the Long Tail Tribe. The Starport . Alula’s interstellar port is rated Type B, and there is both a “high port” and a “low port” here. The port is able to handle both streamlined and non-streamlined ships. By tradition and neutrality treaty, the Nine Fingers Tribe operates the starport. Fuel refining operations on Alula are simple and easy, because several deep seas of mostly methane exist on the planet’s surface. The larger ones have extraction and refining facilities, and the refined fuel is then sold at the low port. The major Cicek tribes in the system also have their own private fuel depots at these refineries. Alula High Port . Alula High Port was originally built under Reticulan control, but later upgraded with help from the Cicek’s Terran allies toward the end of the war. Alula Low Port . Alula Low Port is the center of trade in the system, and the startown that has cropped up around the port is known in Terran as Prosperity City. Prosperity City . Xi Ursae Majoris ACe . This is a rocky planet wracked by volcanoes. Outer Asteroid Belt . Extremely wide band of asteroid that takes up multiple orbits. Astronomers believe this belt is much younger than the rest of the system, and represents three or even four planets that collided in the not-too-distant past. There is some prospecting activity in the outer belt, which is much safer for travel than the inner belt. ",

In later stages of the War, however, Rudra eclipsed Parvati as a transit station, and the local starport fell into disuse. The current population engages in small-scale mining operations, exporting raw ore to Cicek space. This remote world, however, makes an ideal hiding spot for pirates and smugglers, as naval presence amounts to monthly visits by a Patrol Frigate and much rarer “showing of the flag” by a Light Cruiser. While this illegal activity hardly reaches that of Lindworm, Parvati is still a hotbed for interstellar outlawry and all sorts of illicit trade with the anarchic Cicek. From Signal 99: . The Parvati system has four planets, three of them inside the Jump Shadow of the main star. Himavan (Gliese 408) has a Jump Shadow (100D limit) of 59.8 million kilometers. Mena, a gas giant slightly larger and more massive than Jupiter, has its own Jump Shadow of 14.5 million kilometers. Mena is the only planet in the habitable zone of this star; thus, any ship jumping into the system must travel a minimum of 45 million kilometers to clear all Jump Shadows. Parvati is the fourth of five large moons orbiting Mena. The current orbital configuration finds Parvati 47 million kilometers from the closest limit of the Jump Shadow. ",

It is the TLS (Terran Lab Ship) Nakatomi. The Ring (Gliese 408 f-1) . Gliese 408 f-1 is a ring of ice and rock. It includes a moonlet called GX4825, which is the location of the wreck of Tallmadge’s Splendor. From TSAO: . Gliese 408f [called “Indra”] is an unremarkable gas giant with three moons orbiting far beyond its ring system. The ring is composed of ice and rock; 90% of the ring particles are less than 1m in diameter. Ring particles are composed of carbonaceous material, silicates, and frozen methane. The patron, Van Deussen, collects methane chunks but occasionally he will find hydrocarbons or more useful minerals. His theory is that the ring is the pulverized remains of a small moon that was struck by a stellar wanderer. Like all rings, this one is much denser than an asteroid field. However, the ring is only 100m thick at its thickest points. The ship will have to fly above or below the disk of the ring to reach the wreck, and the final approach to the wreck will almost assuredly involve some collisions. Tallmadge’s Splendor, or simply the Splendor, lies on one of the largest bodies in the bright outer edge of the ring, close to, but short of the distance at which particles could gather themselves into a proto-moon. The rock’s relative size does draw smaller particles towards it, but the gravity effect of the gas giant also pulls particles away. The ring arc is active and dangerous as a result; particles move about and collide. The Rock (GX4825) . From TSAO: . GX4825, technically a “moonlet” of Gliese 408f but too insignificant in size to be counted as such in any astronomical document, is a cold tiny lump of rock and dirty methane ice. UWP is 000000-0. The rock is 0.3 km by 0.9 km by 0.4 km. Its surface gravity is well below 0.01G. This moonlet is the final resting place of Tallmadge’s Splendor, a Shaka-class military transport ship. ",

It has grown quickly, due to the influx of cheap decommissioned starships resulting from the Shen administration’s demobilization process. Solana began as a private company flying the Cicek Run in what was then barely-explored space during the War. Now Solana has strong ties with Cicek merchant and industrialist tribes, and imports cheap Cicek goods to Terran space and exports high technology items to the Cicek. Solana also trades with the Ssesslessians, the Technate, and even the Empire, now that the peace agreement permits trade between the former belligerents. Solana has a near-monopoly on interstellar shipping, competing only with Stellardream Inc. and with smaller operations only on the frontier. Solana’s dominance of trade routes is a result of its highly efficient network of carefully-maintained freighters. Solana is well-known for its high salaries and incentive programs for trading crews. Recently, Solana has branched into starship spare part manufacturing to reduce its dependence on TAMI and Stellardream products it uses for fleet maintenance. This company also engages in starport operations, typically as a sub-contractor of the local authorities. Currently, Solana executives consider expanding into the ship-building and overhaul business, though the corporation is yet to take any concrete steps in this direction. ",

It carried thousands of Terran draftees to the front lines to fight for the Reticulans. It was decommissioned after 20 years of duty, and cheaply converted to a mining vessel by the Earth Federal Administration (EFA), the Terran government of the time. The jump drives were removed, along with weapons and cryopods. It has several large internal cargo bays, as well as the capacity to haul a single large rock in a net. There are 3 furnished staterooms, and another 14 that are missing furniture but can house passengers willing to sleep and sit on the floor. From outside, Misty’s Way is a hodge-podge of different components that don’t match. It looks like a piece of junk. The maneuver drive is hugely oversized, especially for the mass of the unloaded ship. But that’s good, because it’s unstable if used at greater than 50% power. The ship, being former military, is armored, which is good for travel in and through the belt. Also, it still has its military redundant power plants - three fusion cores, only two of which need to be online at any time. It also has its original military sensors, a system called the Deep Space Triangulator. The system is outdated but given enough time it can be used to detect and track ships and asteroids much farther away than most civilian ships can. Van Duessen considers this a competitive advantage.

There are only four places of real interest in the Rudra system: . | Rudra - Wolf 359 c: a hostile planet with small boiling caustic oceans | Transom Rock - asteroid with sub-surface city, in orbit around Wolf 359 c | Valcent - Wolf 369 f: a gas giant with an orbiting mass of interconnected ships and cargo containers, inhabited by a human group of separatists that consider themselves independent from the UTR | Gamma - Wolf 396 g: an airless rocky planet that holds a UTR prison (travel here is forbidden) | . Made using Tanner Stephens’s Star System Creator . There are three gas giants, two other smaller planets (in addition to Rudra), and two asteroid belts in the system. But they aren’t notable to most travellers. Background . During the war, Rudra used to be the last stop on the “Cicek Run” before entering Cicek space proper. Today, it is a major trading port with the Cicek Confederation. Rudra itself is a hellish world gripped by a runaway greenhouse effect which possesses a caustic atmosphere. The settlement is actually a large orbital station built into a metallic asteroid to protect its residents from Wolf 359’s infrequent but occasionally powerful stellar flares. Of Rudra’s hundred thousand residents, thirty thousand are Cicek traders and colonists. Their presence on this world over the last generation influenced local Terran culture and led to the infamous Rudra informality among humans living here. The official government is content to stand back and let the locals run their own business undisturbed, much to the chagrin of the Ministry of Finance and the Economy, which would prefer a tighter grip on the flow of goods from and to Cicek space. Adventuring Information: As the border settles down, trade with the Cicek is increasing rapidly. Merchants operating out of Rudra will have a lot of opportunity for profit. Of course competition means danger as the existing corporations may begin dirty trick operations to make any competition feel especially unwelcome here. ",

Transom Rock is a large orbital station built into a metallic asteroid, that was moved from the inner asteroid belt into orbit around Wolf 359 c decades ago. It has 70k Humans and 30k Cicek. The humans are torn into two main factions by violent political disagreement. Each views the other as a damnable heresy in need of extirpating. Local government may be able to keep open war from breaking out, but the poisonous hatred divides communities. The nature of the political disagreement is the Cicek. Half of the Terrans treat the Cicek population as friendly neighbors, and the other half want them to return to Cicek space now that the war is over. The Starport . Rather than being operated by a commercial contractor, as is done on most other UTR colonies, starport operations at Rudra are currently provided directly by the UTR Ministry of Colonization and Space Travel (“The Scouts”). Unrefined fuel is available at the standard subsidized price of 100 Cr per ton. There is no industrial grade fuel refinery, although some entrepreneurial Ciceks have set up a private small-scale refined fuel depot. On any given day, 2D x 10 tons of refined fuel are available for 3D x 100 Cr per ton. The price fluctuates very widely, based on the complexities of inter-tribe competition.

In a major Cicek Rebellion action against the Reticulans his success was a growing legend, but it brought much envy and hatred. Before he was aware of the threat, he was outsmarted, duped even. A rival from another trading house appeared and used his failure against him. Humiliated, he found himself an outcast. He even thought of turning pirate. For a few years, he drifted amongst the Cicek population on Rudra, working security. Now, he is determined to seek glory on Parvati.
