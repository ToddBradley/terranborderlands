## Overview

The starship known as the *Owl Bear* is formally called *United Terran Republic Civilian Vessel OWL BEAR, Registration Number 220-A-422*. It was first put into service 43 years ago, in the year 2217. It was built at Terra's Reticulan-operated shipyard, intended for trained Terran crews to help support their masters in the Reticulan-Chiwak Wars. It disappeared during the revolution of 2232, had some modifications made to support the resistance, and re-appeared a few years later under Terran control.

The *Owl Bear* is currently operated by Zephyros Professional Services on behalf of Quasar Research, a joint partnership between Solana Trading and Chiang Robotics. It is owned by Solana Trading, but it on long term loan contract to Zephyros Professional Services.

The ship's registered master is Mr. [Malek Palfrey](../../player-characters/malek).

The *Owl Bear* is the primary test bed of an experimental artificial intelligence called **The Baracus Device**, which presents as an avatar named **Rockford**.
