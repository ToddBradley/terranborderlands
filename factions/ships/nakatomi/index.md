## Overview

The Type L class Laboratory Ship **Nakatomi** is a civilian research vessel displacing 400 tons. It is unstreamlined, and typically carries a ship crew of 5 plus up to 20 science researchers.

One of those scientists is Perry Dawdson, a lab technician who badly wants his annual bonus from the corporation.

The Nakatomi was recently dispatched to the Gliese 408 ("Parvati") system to investigate "electromagnetic anomalies" in the vicinity of the gas giant Indra.

## Research Pinnace

The Nakatomi is equipped with a 40-ton research pinnace, a small craft capable of scavenging fuel, acquiring specimens, and running errands to other parts of the system or to world surfaces.
