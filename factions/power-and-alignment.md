# Factions in this campaign

This page is for tracking faction power and alignment, in case we decide to take this campaign to the "macro" level where faction-vs-faction relationships are important.

**Faction Power**: the relative power of this group; 1 = a local organization with few resources, 6 = an interstellar organization with money, connections, and wide support

**Faction Alignment**: how closely aligned the group's goals are to the PCs; 1 = diametrically opposed; 6 = maximum support
