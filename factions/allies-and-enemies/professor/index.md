Professor Ghoshal bucks the stereotype of the conservative, bookish collegiate. He is an eternal optimist, always with a smile on his face.

Typical quotes:

* *Dude, this is gonna work. Trust me!*
* *Yeah, but we've got initiative on our side!*
* *It only seems hare-brained to you. Let's just try my idea, and I bet you'll be surprised.*
* *I tested this in twenty simulations, and there wasn't a single error.*
